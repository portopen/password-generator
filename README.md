# password-generator
A simple and secure random password generator written in Python and Tkinter.

The password generator I have created forces the user to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers at a
minimum to provide a strong password. The minimum length of a password is set to twelve, as this
was the minimum recommendation as of the year 2022 (guided by the research done by hivesystems.io). It is strongly recommended
that the user select a password length greater than this in order to future proof their password for the coming years. The user also has the choice to include
special characters by selecting a checkbox. This improves the complexity and strength of the password.

Password complexity and length matter greatly when creating a safe, secure password.
It is my recommendation, based on the findings of hivesystems.io that you create a password
with a minimum length of thirteen characters and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers (as of 2023).
Based on the above recommendation, it would take a hacker three thousand years to brute force your password (in the year 2023).
To future proof your password for the coming years, it is advisable to increase the length of your password beyond the suggested
minimum recommendation. My password recommendations are based on the findings from hivesystems.io.

I have no affiliation with hivesystems.io. They are just a good resource.

I hope you enjoy my application.
